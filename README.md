# UnionApp

## Introduction
This application is an Android application built for the subject 'Mobile Development' during my bachelor education at the PXL Hogeschool Hasselt (2019-2020).

## Functionality
This application is called  **Union App** and its purpose is to keep track on the members of an assocation: music association, youth assocation, ... So you always know who is member of your assocation, where he/she lives, what his/her birthdate is, how to reach him/her by phone, ... You can gain full access to the platform by logging in, after which you can view, edit, create or delete members.

This all is wrapped in a polished application built with attention for design, working with a Firebase backend.
