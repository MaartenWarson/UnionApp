# UnionApp

## Introduction
This application is an Android application built for the subject 'Mobile Development' during my bachelor education at the PXL Hogeschool Hasselt (2019-2020).

With this application it is possible to manage members of an assocation: view, add, edit and delete members. This all is wrapped in a polished application built with attention for design (portait and landscape).
